A Small Blynk-based ESP8266 program to control a Denon amplifier

This project uses Blynk https://blynk.io/ to control an amplifier using an ESP8266 through serial. The specific one I use is a 2803, but it should work on other ones with minor adjustments.
Do keep in mind you'll need a MAX3232 or similar chip to meet RS232 voltage levels.

I did not implement nearly all commands available, just the ones that were useful to me. Feel free to clone this and add your own.
I don't intend for this to be an ongoing projet, I just searched for something like this before writing it but couldn't find anything so I thought this could help someone.
